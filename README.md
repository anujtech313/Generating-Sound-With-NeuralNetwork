The project was build using Vanilla Autoencoder and its updated version variational Autoencoder(VAE)from Scratch. Mnist Dataset was tested on vanilla Autoencoder
and then a dataset of spoken digits from 0-9 was used and generated using VAE ![spoken digits](https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset)
